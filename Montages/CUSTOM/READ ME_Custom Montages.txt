Custom Montages are created to support custom headsets.

To use a Custom Montage, you can load it from DSI-Streamer's Montage Tab.
DSI-Streamer will save the last saved montage in the DSI-Streamer.xml and reload it the next time it is launched.


To make a Custom Montage a default montage to be loaded every time:
you can copy and rename the custom montage to match the name of the headset's default montage: eg. DSI-24_LE_default.mtg
and place that copy in the appropriate headset folder (eg. \Montages\DSI-24)
Now you can select that montage by checking the "Headset Default Montage" checkbox in the Montage Tab.
